# DEVDAY Deep Learning
=====================

## Introduction

1. Neural Networks 

2. Machine Learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, reinforced

3. Deep learning coatains multiple layers. Uses unsupervised learning.


## Neural Networks


1. Parameters

	1. Net Input Fuction
	2. Activation Function
	3. Learning Rate
	4. Error

2. perceptron - (bias and weight)

3. bias(pullup resistor with high voltage)

4. back propagation

5. cost function(minimize error)

6. What should be the initial weight ?

7. local minima for two or more minimas(gradient of function)

8. Vanishing gradient problem.

9. Activation functions

10. google deep learning: Identify the objects in the image

11. recuurrent neural network.

## Excercise

1. Translational invariant

2. We have to increase mask size as we go higher level

3. Regularisation and dropout

4. Max pooling

5. Normalize values 
	Why? To keep them between 1 and -1 so that they dont go out of range during processing

6. Activation functions:  relu, softmax
